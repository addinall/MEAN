# MEAN-APP

A little play with using a MEAN application stack
that will hopefully give me the basis for my new
RESTful stack under development.  I was going to
use angular with a set of PHP REST APIs, I still
might, but this needs a try out as well.

I like the idea of using Javascript all through the
stack for the front, mid and back end, and always
using JSON as the data package WITHOUT pesky add-on
libaries.  I tried the mean.io stack but like
most things written by "bubbly, young and dynamic"
coders it was BIG, FAT, UGLY and CRAP.

So, the list of stuff in use includes:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* AngularJS
* BootstrapJS
* MongoDB
* NodeJS
* npm
* Express
* Mongoose
* JSON
* Passport


I trust that is sufficiently "New Age" for y'all?
